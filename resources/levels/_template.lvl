# This is a commentary
# Only use red/green/blue/gold for ball color please, don't have sprites for other :)
# Balls, use this form: 
# x, y, rad, vx, vy, color, split_times, split_into; use spaces in between
# If you want to randomize, use (start,stop) for the value you want to randomize
# If you want to make it a random +-, use * before the value
# Example:
# (100,700) *(100,200) 100 100 *100 blue 2 2
