The Ballgame I first made as a school project using Tkinter, which I later migrated
to Pygame, now in Pyglet as an excercise. 

It's a simple game with (when I implement it :P) two player support, where you move left/right
and try to shoot down the colored balls, which can split into more smaller balls on hit. 

Heavily inspired by an old DOS game by the name of Ball (I think, can't remember, I know it had
some Chinese/Japanese letters in the title image somewhere ... )
